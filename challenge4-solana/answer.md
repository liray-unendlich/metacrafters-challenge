- Simpler if the contract is break (simply XOR the receive)
- Sends the transaction directly to the RPC server
- Difference between using SDK or RPC API
- With SDK, you can do it faster because you don't use a server, but you have to do the calculations yourself (transaction data and signature)
- With a server, you can send and create transactions even with a more lightweight client.
